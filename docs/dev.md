# Developper documentation

Thanks for looking at this documentation.

If you didn't read [the addon presentation](../README.md#presentation), go check it out first to learn how this repository is structured.

> [!NOTE]
> Disclamer: We are new developpers into Ayon's ecosystem.
> The following documentation might require some improvements and we may have missed something.
> Feel free to update this file or directly reach us at [support@fatfi.sh](mailto:support@fatfi.sh)

## Requirements

We will need to clone several Ayon repositories in order to run everything locally:

- You need to [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) first.
- [Ayon Docker](https://github.com/ynput/ayon-docker)
- [Ayon Core](https://github.com/ynput/ayon-core)
  - You can clone this one, into `ayon-docker/addons/core` folder. Here is the steps :
    2. From the `core` folder execute this command:
       - `git clone ssh://git@github.com:ynput/ayon-core.git dev`
       - This command will clone the repository and rename it `dev`, in order to follow [Ayon addon directory structure](https://ayon.ynput.io/docs/admin_server_installing_addons#directory-structure)
- [Ayon dependencies](https://github.com/ynput/ayon-dependencies-tool)
- [Aquarium addon](https://github.com/ynput/ayon-aquarium)
  - You can clone this one, into `ayon-docker/addons` folder. Here is the steps :
    1. Create a folder `ayon-aquarium` in `ayon-docker/addons` folder
    2. From the `ayon-aquarium` folder execute this command:
       - `git clone ssh://git@github.com:ynput/ayon-aquarium.git dev`
       - This command will clone the repository and rename it `dev`, in order to follow [Ayon addon directory structure](https://ayon.ynput.io/docs/admin_server_installing_addons#directory-structure)

### Optional requirements

If you are looking for Python type check, we will need extra steps:

1. Clone [Ayon Backend](https://github.com/ynput/ayon-backend) repository
2. Clone [Aquarium python API](https://github.com/fatfish-lab/aquarium-python-api)
3. Create a new pyenv dedicated for development `pyenv virtualenv ayondevaquarium` using python 3.10.12
4. Enable your pyenv `pyenv shell ayondevaquarium` and/or select this pyenv in your IDE.
5. Install dependencies from your local repositories
   1. `python -m pip install -e /path/to/aquarium-python-api`
   2. `python -m pip install -e /path/to/ayon-backend`

## Setup dev environment


### 1. Start Ayon

Start your Ayon instances, from the Ayon Docker repository, using the command `docker compose up --build`. For a more precise steps, check out the repository README file.

### 2. Create a service user

To interact with Ayon server, we need to create a service User.

1. On your Ayon server, create a service user from `Studio settings` > `Users` tab > `Add new user`. Choose `Service` in the access level section.
1. On the newly created Service User, generate an API Key.
   1. Keep that API key, we will use it later.

### 3. Upload addon to Ayon

1. From your `ayon-aquarium` folder, execute the file `create_package.py`
2. Locate the `.zip` file created in the new folder `package`
3. From Ayon server web interface, go to `Studio settings` > `Bundles` tab.
4. Click on the button `Install addon` and upload your previous `.zip` file.
5. Restart your Ayon server

### 4. Create a dev bundle

1. From the `Studio settings` > `Bundles` tab, create a new bundle `aquarium-dev` (choose the name you want)
2. Assign your self as a developper on this bundle
3. Locate `aquarium` line in the addon list, and select the version where you have a `+git` at the end.
4. Enable addon directory and paste the location of the client folder `ayon-docker/addons/ayon-aquarium/dev/client`
5. Locate `core` line in the addon list, and select the version where you have a `+git` at the end.
6. Enable addon directory and paste the location of the client folder `ayon-docker/addons/core/dev/client`
7. Don't forget to save your dev bundle by clicking on the top right button `Save bundle`

### 5. Build Ayon dependencies

1. From the Ayon dependencies repository folder, copy the file `example_env` as `.env` file.
2. Edit this file and add your local Ayon dev serveur URL and your previously generated service API key.
3. Run the command `./start install`
4. Run the command `./start create -b aquarium-dev` (Use the name of the previously bundle you created)
   1. This command will create and upload the dependencies to your Ayon server

### 6. Update bundle dependencies

1. From the `Studio settings` > `Bundles` tab, select your `aquarium-dev` bundle.
2. In the right panel, locate the section `Dependency Packages`
3. Edit dependencies of your OS to select the latest upload dependencies

Congratulations, you are now good to go developping ! ðŸŽ‰

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Don't forget to restart your Ayon server if you work on the server part, it's the only way to take your modification in consideration.
